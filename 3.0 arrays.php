// Sheesh.
// So,
// All the 3 variables above can store only ONE, yes..
// ONLY ONE value at a time.  But what if you want a

//
// If that need ever arises, you have to use arrays!
// There are 2 types of arrays:
// 1. Indexed Arrays
// 2. Associative Arrays.



$this_is_an_array = array();

// We have created 2 empty arrays.
// It is advisable to use the first method to *declare* an array.
// The second method is comparatively new one and not supported
// by older versions of PHP.
// Which older versions you ask?
// - Google that you lazy piece of shit.
