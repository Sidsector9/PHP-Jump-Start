/**
 * What am I? 
 * - A variable.
 *
 * What's my use?
 * - To store value.
 *
 * What kind of value?
 * - A number, string, reference or nothing at all!
 *
 * Are there any naming conventions for a variable?
 * - Yes, a variable must start with a `$` and
 * - should contain a-zA-Z0-9 or _
 *
 * Does storing value in variable equate to storing in
 * database?
 * - LOL NO! Variables will store values as far as this
 * - script is running in memory (RAM). The database
 * - stores the value even on computer shutdown.
 *
 * [Tip: Following examples have meaningful variable names,
 * pay attention.]
